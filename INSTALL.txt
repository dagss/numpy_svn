Building and installing NumPy

PREREQUISITES
=============

Building NumPy requires the following software installed:

1) Python__ 2.4.x or newer

   On Debian and derivative (Ubuntu): python python-dev

   On Windows: the official python installer on Python__ is enough

   Make sure that the Python package distutils is installed before
   continuing. For example, in Debian GNU/Linux, distutils is included
   in the python-dev package.

   Python must also be compiled with the zlib module enabled.

Building with ATLAS support
===========================

Ubuntu 8.10 (Intrepid)
----------------------

You can install the necessary packages for optimized ATLAS with this command:

    sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev

If you have a recent CPU with SIMD suppport (SSE, SSE2, etc...), you should
also install the corresponding package for optimal performances. For example,
for SSE2:

    sudo apt-get install libatlas3gf-sse2

*NOTE*: if you build your own atlas, Intrepid changed its default fortran
compiler to gfortran. So you should rebuild everything from scratch, including
lapack, to use it on Intrepid.

Ubuntu 8.04 and lower
---------------------

You can install the necessary packages for optimized ATLAS with this command:

    sudo apt-get install atlas3-base-dev

If you have a recent CPU with SIMD suppport (SSE, SSE2, etc...), you should
also install the corresponding package for optimal performances. For example,
for SSE2:

    sudo apt-get install atlas3-sse2
