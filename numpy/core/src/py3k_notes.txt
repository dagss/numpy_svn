Notes on making the transition to python 3.x
============================================

The PyTypeObject of py3k is binary compatible with the py2k version and the
old initializers should work. However, there are several considerations to
keep in mind.

1) Because the first three slots are now part of a struct some compilers issue
warnings if they are initialized in the old way.

2) The compare slot has been made reserved in order to preserve binary
compatibily while the tp_compare function went away. The tp_richcompare
function has replaced it and we need to use that slot instead. This will
likely require modifications in the searchsorted functions and generic sorts
that currently use the compare function.

3) The previous numpy practice of initializing the COUNT_ALLOCS slots was
bogus. They are not supposed to be explicitly initialized and were out of
place in any case because an extra base slot was added in python 2.6.

Because of these facts it was thought better to use #ifdefs to bring the old
initializers up to py3k snuff rather than just fill the tp_richcompare slot.
They also serve to mark the places where changes have been made. Thus the form
of the PyTypeObject initializers are now as follows, illustrated by the
PyUFunc_Type initializer.
