Merging documentation back from Doc-Wiki
========================================

This document describes how to merge back docstring edits from the pydocweb
wiki (at http://docs.scipy.org/doc/) to NumPy/SciPy trunk.

Basic steps
-----------
It works like this, both for NumPy and SciPy:

1. Go to http://docs.scipy.org/scipy/patch/ and log in.
2. click on "Select OK to apply"
3. click on "Generate patch"
4. select all the text in the browser and save as a patch.
5. check the patch file for errors, edit if necessary
6. apply patch (typically ``patch -p1 < newdocs.patch`` from base numpy dir).
7. run tests to see if nothing broke
8. commit

Errors in patch file
--------------------
Note that it is necessary to check the generated patch before trying to apply.
If there are errors they are noted at the top of the file. There are two known
reasons for errors:

* If the error message is "source location for docstring is not
  known", then the function usually needs to get handled with
  ``add_newdoc()`` in numpy/add_newdocs.py.

* If there are other messages, this may indicate a bug in the
  patch generation itself.
