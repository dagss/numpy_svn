Warning on casting complex to real
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Numpy now emits a `numpy.ComplexWarning` when a complex number is cast
into a real number. For example:

    >>> x = np.array([1,2,3])
    >>> x[:2] = np.array([1+2j, 1-2j])
    ComplexWarning: Casting complex values to real discards the imaginary part

The cast indeed discards the imaginary part, and this may not be the
intended behavior in all cases, hence the warning. This warning can be
turned off in the standard way:

    >>> import warnings
    >>> warnings.simplefilter("ignore", np.ComplexWarning)
