* :pep:`3118` compatibility


Highlights

New features
============

Warning on casting complex to real
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Numpy now emits a `numpy.ComplexWarning` when a complex number is cast
into a real number. For example:

    >>> x = np.array([1,2,3])
    >>> x[:2] = np.array([1+2j, 1-2j])
    ComplexWarning: Casting complex values to real discards the imaginary part

The cast indeed discards the imaginary part, and this may not be the
intended behavior in all cases, hence the warning. This warning can be
turned off in the standard way:

    >>> import warnings
    >>> warnings.simplefilter("ignore", np.ComplexWarning)

Dot method for ndarrays
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ndarrays now have the dot product also as a method, which allows writing
chains of matrix products as

    >>> a.dot(b).dot(c)

instead of the longer alternative

    >>> np.dot(a, np.dot(b, c))

linalg.slogdet function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The slogdet function returns the sign and logarithm of the determinant
of a matrix. Because the determinant may involve the product of many
small/large values, the result is often more accurate than that obtained
by simple multiplication.

new header
~~~~~~~~~~

There is a new header ndarraytypes.h that provides needed ndarray types
that don't reference the ndarray c-api. Some folks might find this useful.
