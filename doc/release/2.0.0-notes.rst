* :pep:`3118` compatibility


Highlights

New features
============

Warning on casting complex to real
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Numpy now emits a `numpy.ComplexWarning` when a complex number is cast
into a real number. For example:

    >>> x = np.array([1,2,3])
    >>> x[:2] = np.array([1+2j, 1-2j])
    ComplexWarning: Casting complex values to real discards the imaginary part

The cast indeed discards the imaginary part, and this may not be the
intended behavior in all cases, hence the warning. This warning can be
turned off in the standard way:

    >>> import warnings
    >>> warnings.simplefilter("ignore", np.ComplexWarning)

Dot method for ndarrays
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ndarrays now have the dot product also as a method, which allows writing
chains of matrix products as

    >>> a.dot(b).dot(c)

instead of the longer alternative

    >>> np.dot(a, np.dot(b, c))

linalg.slogdet function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The slogdet function returns the sign and logarithm of the determinant
of a matrix. Because the determinant may involve the product of many
small/large values, the result is often more accurate than that obtained
by simple multiplication.

new header
~~~~~~~~~~

The new header file ndarraytypes.h contains the symbols from
ndarrayobject.h that do not depend on the PY_ARRAY_UNIQUE_SYMBOL and
NO_IMPORT/_ARRAY macros. Broadly, these symbols are types, typedefs,
and enumerations; the array function calls are left in
ndarrayobject.h. This allows users to include array-related types and
enumerations without needing to concern themselves with the macro
expansions and their side- effects.
