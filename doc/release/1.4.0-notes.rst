=========================
NumPy 1.4.0 Release Notes
=========================

This minor includes numerous bug fixes.

Highlights
==========

New features
============

New ufuncs
~~~~~~~~~~

#. copysign - return the value of the first argument with the sign copied from
   the second argument.

Internal changes
================

split multiarray and umath
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The source code of multiarray and umath has been split into separate logic
units. This should make the source code more amenable for newcomers.

Separate compilation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, every file of multiarray (and umath) is merged into one for
compilation, but if NPY_SEPARATE_COMPILATION env variable is set to a
non-negative value, experimental individual compilation of each file is
enabled. This makes the compile/debug cycle much faster when working on core
numpy.

Separate core math library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New functions which have been added:
	* npy_copysign
